00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:43.030
It contains all your submissions, and a way to tag them and search them.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:53.640
For example, as an editor, you can quickly find submissions tagged as priority that need you to make an assessment and decide whether to
accept or reject the submission.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.200
Let's look at this submission needing an assessment.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.400
You see what has to be done, and when it is due.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.190
Here, we see we need to make a decision and it's due in three days.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.590
And you have all the information you need to make a decision.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.920
The reviews submitted by the reviewers are available as attachments.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.010
Below the reviews, you have the contents of the manuscript and any reviewer comments in context.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.950
If you need to check a previous version, you have access to the entire history of the submission.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:45.490
When submissions are accepted, they become immediately available on the journal homepage as production-ready articles, with resources embedded and rich metadata in context.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:02:05.140
In addition to a DOI [digital object identifier], all articles have human readable identifiers so you can link to any section, any paragraph, or any resource in the article so science can finally be referenced and shared precisely.
