Hey guys, my name is Jess Richman and I like to go kiteboarding ridiculously overpowered.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
When I have more kite than I need I'm able to just kind of do more fun things and I like it but a lot times you know it's hard to hold it down.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
One of the problems that I've solved this year with the new ride engine harnesses is actually being able to hold down a bigger kite

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Because the harnessess have the hard shell, the low profile design, I can actually get more leverage on the kite to lean against the kite harder and hold out much longer than I should ride.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:47.000
With the new harnesses I'm able to jump higher and you know, just get more stoked.
